### Design Choices

I opted for a clean, modern aesthetic with a white header/footer and dark text to prioritize readability and professionalism, while the purple gradient hero section adds visual contrast and tech-inspired vibrancy. The layout uses Bootstrap’s responsive grid to ensure clarity across devices, with collapsible navigation for mobile users. Projects are showcased in an interactive carousel with modal popups to balance detail with simplicity, while the skills proficiency sliders provide an at-a-glance view of your competencies. The playful 404 redirect on demo buttons adds personality without compromising functionality.

### Content Organization

Content follows a hierarchical flow (Hero → About → Projects → Skills → Contact) to guide visitors naturally through your narrative. Project modals highlight technologies used (pulled from your actual work), and the bold navbar text ensures clear navigation. The design intentionally avoids clutter, using whitespace and card-based layouts to let your work shine. Every choice—from the terminal-like monospace headings to the smooth scroll behavior—reinforces your identity as a developer while keeping the UX intuitive.
