Design Philosophy & Choices
This portfolio embraces a clean, tech-forward aesthetic with purposeful contrast between the vibrant blue gradient hero section and minimalist white content areas. The design prioritizes user experience through intuitive information hierarchy - starting with an impactful hero, flowing naturally into project showcases, and concluding with clear contact options. Technical credibility is reinforced through terminal-inspired monospace headings (Share Tech Mono) paired with the modern readability of Space Grotesk for body text. Interactive elements like the skill proficiency bars and project modals provide engagement without compromising the professional tone, while the playful 404 redirect adds subtle personality.

Functional Decisions
Every design choice serves dual purposes - the collapsible navbar ensures mobile responsiveness, the card-based project display maintains visual consistency across devices, and strategic whitespace reduces cognitive load. The blue gradient hero immediately establishes a tech aesthetic, while the dark-on-light content sections optimize readability. Interactive components (carousels, modals, smooth scrolling) were carefully implemented to demonstrate technical ability while enhancing usability. The result is a portfolio that balances professional presentation with thoughtful user experience, effectively showcasing both design sensibility and technical capability.
